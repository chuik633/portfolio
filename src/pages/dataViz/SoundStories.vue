    `This project was my thesis for my masters in Data Viz at Parsons NYC! In
    Sound Stories, I experimented with visualizing music, as music is a powerful
    story telling device that can express emotion, signify themes, and convey
    intensity. In this project, I used p5 to created audio reactive typography
    for the captions of films. `

    `In the backend, I built my own processing pipeline with yt-dlp and FFMPEG
    to download youtube videos, extract image data, audio data, and captions. I
    used FFTs, spectrograms, and chromagrams to process the audio files, and I
    used clustering on the colors of the film to get thematic color palettes.For
    the backend, I used Docker, fly.io, and supabase to store the uploaded
    youtube data.`
